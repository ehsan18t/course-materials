### Network Component
 - End Devices `[Client, Server]`
 - Intermediate Devices `[Hub, Switch, Router]`
 - Media `[NIC, Transmission Media]`

**End Device:** Where the data being produce.\
**Intermediate Device:** Only redirect/forward requests to other devices.\
**Media:** Network hardware like `Network Card`.

### Layers
 - Application Layer
 - Transport Layer `[TCP/UDP]`
 - Networking Layer `[Router/ IP]`
 - Data Link Layer `[MAC Address]`
 - Physical Layer `[Hardware]`

### Terminology
 - Unicast - Send data to particularly tergeted device.
 - Forwarding/Flooding - Send data to everyone except the original sender.
 - Broadcasting - Send data to everyone.
 - Multicast - Send data to selected devices.
 - Bandwidth - Rate of data transmission.

### Knowledge
 - Hub uses `Flooding/Forwarding`.
 - Switch can do everything hub can.
 - Switch and hub only works with mac address.
 - Routing - Based on destination sends data to a particular direction.
 - Router - The devices that does the routing are the routers.
